                      I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and
                      knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me

                    <strong>1) Universal password saver -</strong>
                    UPS allows you to store usernames, passwords, URLs, etc. in an
                    encrypted database protected by one master password(finger print). Its three strongest features
                    are simplicity (it provides a small number of very strong features with no clutter (untidy
                    state)), the ability to run cross-platform, and database sharing. Rather than having many
                    separate databases (home, work, etc.), database sharing allows you store your database at a
                    remote location (password protected HTTP URL, for example) and then have UPS automatically keep
                    your local database in sync with the remote database.
                    It allows you to store usernames, passwords, URLs and generate notes in an encrypted database
                    protected by one master password.<br>
                    <b>Key Features</b>- <br>
                    1)Simplicity - it provides a small number of very strong features with no clutter<br>
                    2)Cross platform - UPM runs on Android, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux<br>
                    3)Uses AES(advanced encryption standard) for database encryption
                    <br>
                    Displayed in innovation and NES platform, and i am currently working on it, to make it more
                    better and advance.<br>

                    <strong>2) Medical Drone Delivery System - </strong>
                    A medical delivery system which supplies required medical supplies like medicine, vaccine, even
                    blood and organs at a faster, efficient rate. it is commercially efficient as well as it is a
                    low cost model for medical supplies to remote areas and in border areas which are dangerous for
                    us to visit.
                    <br>
                    <b>Key Features</b>-
                    <br>
                    1)It can reach the places in the time of emergency easily where it is difficult to reach.<br>
                    2)It provide night vision camera to see objects and person in the absence of light.<br>
                    3)This hardware provides secure, convenient and fast service in emergency.<br>

                    <strong>3) Hospital Database Management System - </strong>
                    In an array of systems-engineering tools and associated techniques for analyzing, designing,
                    controlling, and improving health care delivery processes and systems. The Large Medium
                    -Hospitals and Nursing Homes ,Physicians, Surgeons ,Gynecologist. Generate Prescriptions in very
                    less time. Multi-user, LAN, Online and Offline Compatible with any Windows 7 ,8 ,10 or higher
                    version.
                    We are also able to communicate faster and more efficiently within the hospital and also among
                    other hospitals using this technology which includes native software techniques and RPA. This
                    HDMS-application provides many convenient facility for users (patient, hospital or other
                    committees). Such as- SMS Facility . Patient ID card with Patient online login ID and password
                    (which is generated during admitting patient for the first time).
                    <br>
                    <b>Key Features</b>-<br>
                    1) Checking availability of nearby medical facilities , based on search criteria.<br>
                    2) Facility for checking related medical government schemes, as applicable. Additional features
                    are welcome.<br>
                    3) Integration of Data.<br>

                    platform.<br>
                    <strong>4) B+ tree project - </strong>This is a research-based project and the basic point
                    motivating this project is
                    learning and implementing algorithms that reduces time complexity.<br>
                    B+ tree is the extension of b tree or we can say it is used to remove the problem faced with the
                    b tree i.e. in b tree
                    every node has a record associated with it whereas in b+ tree the leaf node has the replica of
                    all the non-leaf and
                    root node and from there the record is accessed. And the leaf nodes are connected sequentially
                    using pointers.
                    B tree is depth-ward searching which is very time consuming and complex therefore b+ tree is
                    preferred.<br>
                    <b>Key Features</b>-<br>
                    1)Searching in Relational Database is faster with the help of indexing using B-tree data
                    structures.<br>
                    2)While searching, hitting the hard disk with the use of table scan is now reduced. <br>
                    <strong>5) Fire Alarm Security System - </strong>In this fire alarm circuit project, a
                    thermistor works as the heat sensor. When temperature increases, its resistance decreases, and
                    vice versa.<br>

                  I always begin by considering a client’s website objectives and then move on to an Information Architecture (IA) to set a website’s information hierarchy and help guide the design process. Next, I start creating wireframes and finally move to the design stage. I use several basic design principles to achieve an aesthetically pleasing layout which also offers excellent user experience such as -FIGMA.

                  I use scripting languages or a more dynamic approach incorporating programming languages such as PHP to develop website pages. For more advanced development choose to utilize a CMS like WordPress or Joomla in order to streamline development.
